# FSU Coding Support Group
**Purpose**: A repository for documenting, archiving, and sharing code related to the FSU "Coding Support Group" and FSU-wide activities. 

## Current Proposed Format (3/6/2015)
* Bi-weekly meeting on Fridays at 9:15AM; Pine meeting room.
* *Sessions* are hosted by a pair of facilitators. 
* *Facilitators* prepare a rather informal meeting with a set topic, brief outline of tasks or goals, code examples, and (if applicable) data. 
* Learning new techniques, reviewing important conventions, developing useful tools, and exposure to different coding styles is the *spirit* of the group. 

## Long-term Goals
* Expand FSU team member coding skills and knowledge. 
* Develop a "directory" for generally useful coding functions and tools.
* Collaborate and develop useful tools, apps, and workflows for future FSU tasks (i.e. automating ATBD output assessment).
